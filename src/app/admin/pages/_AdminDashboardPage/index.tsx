import React from "react";
import {Space, Title} from "@mantine/core";

export const AdminDashboardPage = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <span>Admin Dashboard</span>

            <Title>
                The first and most important this is to work on "ACTIVE" link in the navbar (NavbarLinksGroup)
                <Space h="md" />
                Currently there is not indication or whatsoever that the link is active

                <Space h="xl" />
                <Space h="xl" />
                <Space h="xl" />
                <Space h="xl" />
                The second thing is to work on the logout button in the navbar (UserNavigationButton).
                <Space h="md" />
                There should appear some popup with available actions which can be defined in AdminUserButtonSection and any other user button section
            </Title>
